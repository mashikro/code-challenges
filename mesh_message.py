# You wrote a trendy new messaging app, MeshMessage, to get around flaky cell phone coverage.

# Instead of routing texts through cell towers, your app sends messages via the phones 
# f nearby users, passing each message along from one phone to the next until it reaches 
# the intended recipient. (Don't worryâ€”the messages are encrypted while they're in transit.)

# Some friends have been using your service, and they're complaining that it takes a 
# long time for messages to get delivered. After some preliminary debugging, you suspect 
# messages might not be taking the most direct route from the sender to the recipient.

# THINK: Shortest path aka 0BFS

# Given information about active users on the network, find the shortest route for a 
# message from one user (the sender) to another (the recipient). Return a list of users that make up this route.
